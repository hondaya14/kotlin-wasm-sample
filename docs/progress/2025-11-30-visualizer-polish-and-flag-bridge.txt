Context:
- Finalize SPEC features: hover/pan interactions, optional localStorage restore, and Gradle -Pvisualizer flag bridging to Webpack DefinePlugin.

Changes:
- Chart hover: LineChart now shows a vertical guide and point marker with hovered value and displays it in the header.
- Pan/zoom: Added window size (s) and pan offset (s) controls; all series slice by window and offset.
- Local storage: Added Save Local / Restore Local / Clear Local using localStorage under key `visualizer_session`.
- Gradle bridge: `composeApp/build.gradle.kts` propagates `-Pvisualizer=true` to env `VISUALIZER` for Node/webpack tasks so `__VISUALIZER__` is defined.
- README: Documented both `-Pvisualizer=true` and `VISUALIZER=1` enablement and updated feature list.

Validation:
- Unit tests unchanged (ring buffer, JSON, trends) still relevant.
- Manual (expected): with flag enabled, charts update; hover shows values; pan offset moves window; Save/Restore Local works; long tasks and JS heap behave per browser support.

Notes / Risks:
- Wasm memory sampling relies on a globally exposed `wasmMemory` if available; guarded when absent.
- Gradle task type coverage uses NodeJsExec/KotlinWebpack; environments may vary across plugin versions.
