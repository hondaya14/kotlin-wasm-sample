Task: Implement docs/tasks.md

Context:
- Align task plan with docs/SPEC.md and project guidelines.

Work Done:
- Verified and finalized docs/tasks.md with clear milestones (M1–M4), acceptance criteria, file map, and build/run commands.
- Ensured consistency with SPEC: metrics, sampling intervals, feature-flag wiring, export/import schema, and UI interactions.

Next Steps:
- Follow tasks.md to implement/iterate remaining milestones as needed.
- Update README with enablement and browser support if anything changes during implementation.
